**Caveat emptor!** Highly variable quality.

Please ask me ahead of time if you're interested in any of these.

* tale about college kid body snatched, the experience of being disembodied, ending with "..." and finally "I hear music". Link to til-death and 4322
* secondary cognitohazard, it doesn't affect the primary observer, but those who observe them are effected. bypasses the foundation's coghaz protocols. report written by D-class
* cognitohazardous DRM, images/media which appears to humans as intended, but only for the person purchasing the media (custom-made)
* infohazardous markers embedded in image modification programs to detect photoshopped images. "Non-Functional Token"? 
* tale about a foundation agent going through a hundred bunk conspiraries nonsense for every one anomaly they find
* (explained) guy accidentally creates a binary format which trips up bots which censor it. they start getting curious about the disappearances and the Foundation needs to patch. they enact conprocs because veil, not because anomalous
* (explained, doa?) original unmodified human in liquid suspension. they are grayscale, can lucid dream, and other modifications applied from anomalies
* (explained) brain damage and major memory loss from amnestic use
* (end-of-death) right-wing media snippets morally equivocating over body snatching
* (end-of-death) SH format about "brain blessing", which allows ectoentropic regeneration of your body if left alone. may take decades
* (end-of-death) Life Sentence without Parole: How the normal world adjusts to Omega-K: prison and justice system edition. mention constitutional amendment that adds 100-year term limits to SCOTUS
* (end-of-death) class-z mnestics
* (broken masquerade?) usa embargoes foundation, we see how self-sufficient they are, plus politics
* (broken masquerade) Wikipedia article for the Wanderer's Library
* (broken masquerade) anomaly that mostly eliminates the need for sleep in humans, decreases tiredness. first available to celebrities who sing its praises. then news articles about a "post-sleep world" and increased productivity leading to utopia. becomes accessible to middle-income people. becomes more common, hours start to increase. poor people are offered loans for the treatment, selling it as anti-poverty (they can work more, earn more money, be in a better position). jobs start to require anti-sleep thing. soon status quo returns, with take home wages slightly lower than before, and people now with far less free time. ends with the first "live in"jobs for the poorest, who effectively work constantly
* Foundation controls massive oligopolies, capitalism and it are tied. (broken masquerade) if the info is leaked
* crystal or something that "controls people's minds". but interviews with people who "resisted its effects" show that it has no control at all, it is read-only. all the actions are "free" because nobody would behave in a way that causes "bad" thoughts to be recorded because it affects their livelihood. those who "resisted" are those few who voluntarily rejected the system and accepted its hostile consequences
* (unfounded) "the room where it happened" - the story of the SCPF's founding, and how it didn't happen. introduce the different component organizations, their squabbling, and how it didn't come together. in a post-meeting, two people are discussing it, and they hear news that Fritz was killed in a car accident on the way there, at the end
* (unfounded) civilian development of mnestics and subsequent issues. (quote about "forget-me-nots"?)
* (unfounded) 2875 [town that was fucked by bears]
* (undervegas) las vegas temple, mormonism, spirituality, and demons
* (undervegas) demons sue the foundation for converting vegas' water supply into holy water
* (undervegas) demon daemons
* (parawatch) pizza delivery driver tells weird things they've found
* (parawatch) group of civvies who know "anomalous terminology" (imagine a real world wiki reader who uses concepts like "cognitohazard" to barely escape a real life anomalous event), and encounter an anomaly and survive (partially?) but they know better than to say "bigfoot did it" and cover it up themselves, they pretend it was a non anomalous freak accident, but crewtime notices the inconsistencies and there's an underlying anomalous explanation
* guy is in the bathroom, using his phone to message, still is messaging but walks out and all the humans are... not human? and they don't see him as human either. same world but different "humans". he can't speak to them or understand, but it turns out that English is identical as written, he can keep messaging his friends but once they see him they essentially can't communicate. contrast between friendship solidarity in hard times and being dropped into an alien world where you're alone and overwhelmed 
* (apollyon) easy-to-use and publicly-known techniques for anomalous memetics. social media posts showing everyone making their own and subsequent chaos
* (apollyon?) world revolution as a result of the straining against reality of human will vs forced normalcy. people try and break free of the consensus and achieve liberation 
* "Side B" -- skip about what DEEPWELL is, and they realize a bunch of information was written in the "-z" (or something) direction, which they previously ignored, akin to the "side b" of a tape. the story is about what they find
* luck industry which operates as a charity to make the world better. but it's totally exhausted and cannot keep going. commentary on how charities cannot fix the problems of capitalism
* person sleeps on empty stomach? poor quality sleep, says they dreamed of fighting dreamer with magic but nothing worked. then cut to different world or location. Foundation investigating group of thaumaturges (magic is normal) saying they tried to defend themselves against a terrible entity but all of their powers were somehow suppressed. dream was "real" basically 
* creepypasta parawatch or scp about a children's book making reference to a dark unseen thing never shown anywhere and treated as normal. possible end: make the unknown thing actually the scpf?
* SCPF tries and builds all their core infra on non-anomalous tech, especially that they can reproduce. they have all this, then they realize something core like cpu manufacturing is actually anomalous and they're swcrewed
* allergy or sensistivity to amnestics preventing civilian release. maybe incentivizes D-class recruitment?
* scp about a d-class riot. the anomaly assisted the rioters or otherwise makes a statement about their imprisonment
* Tale (maybe skip?) from a parallel universe (without a Foundation?) where earth is invaded/colonized by extraterrestrials. Story is told exclusively from the perspective of Wikipedia talk pages and arbitration committee minutes
* Foundation finds parallel earth but describes the weird social divisions they have. "all the creatures are indistinguishable but have to conform to specific roles". eventually revealed that origin SCPF has no sex/gender/differentiation at all, and they're describing our world
* Disease that baseline humans are resistant against, only thaumaturgic or some kinds of anomalous humanoids deal with. Safe? if "GRIDS"/HIV, Euclid if some other narrative approach (or maybe Safe anyways)
* Paranormal Incident Sentencing Court (PISC) - anomalous US court system, similarities to FISC
* US border police know the land, and can thus force migrants into dangerous areas, causing death via terrain. an anomalous weapon, car, device, something will appear and kill/destroy us border personnel and equipment (or SCPF cops), leaving migrants alone. Focus on how the SCPF focuses on institutional harm, because they care about effects to US CBP more than migrants because of contracts and agreements
* thaumaturge contained after crash, they use abilities to protect civilians. simple lede, dive into containment controversy with anomalous community and ethcom case
* anomalous "lie detector" which actually influences people to repeat what authority figures around them are inclined to believe. found in multiple local police departments, and used to get false confessions. Alt, it actually just predicts what they think they'll say and punishes people for weird things happening. llm generation analogue
* hook: generic humanoid containment, then amendment saying ethcom has ordered all of them to be returned, and the only entities allowed are diplomatic entities for temporary periods. descr: portal where occasionally humanoids will emerge, and consent to containment. later it's discovered the alternate world is using the SCPF as a prison. they comply because they are told the SCPF will torture/harm them for even minor irregularities
* something set in an abandoned mall
* machine that can determine someone's intentions. explore ethical and meta concerns
* DEEPWELL isn't actually as reliable as it seems -- go into technological limitations, legacy, and the scary realizations when you combine it with CK-class (imply it causes bad alterations and you can't even know? or unfalsifiability in general?) 
* EURion constellation but for the Foundation, to prevent civilian printers from printing certain kinds of materials
* raisa transcribing and managing documents, coghaz protocols
* raisa post-mortem for incident. not in-progress
* extensive raid log, framed as full record kept from main SCP files. show how the Foundation actually operates, feeling of excitement without dialogue and horror at how agents treat civilians
* extensive containment log, from initial reports, discovery, investigation (every single test performed, most negative), initial containment, research, permanent containment, classification and filing. the end is a very simple anomaly. shows how thorough they are
* death oracle, device that can tell if you will die in 24 hours. provides a kind message to them if so. 24 hours before it malfunctions, it it sends a kinder message to its past.
* ACID but for reality, rollbacks on failure
* generic anomalous object. in containment for a very long time, starting to decay. story is about attempts to restore it, determine how to fix it, idk
* corpse which has totally different autopsy results based on who does it (local police, local hospital, FBI UIU, SCPF)
* concept, thaumobaric sink, kind of SRA like for magic. different mechanism and pros/cons
* cat is a powerful reality bender or apex tier pluripotent entity. however it is content to simply live life with its human. it bends probability and timelines or something that prevent harm but otherwise leaves things be. so no direct containment, just observation. main conproc is maintain the veil, treat human as non-veil Class-A human (don't allow harm or anomaly contact, but the cat mostly takes care of that anyways) and (planned) occasional record alteration when they realize the cat is immortal. human really loves the cat but it's considered mundane not compulsive, the cat chose a human who is a cat person. unsure when it came into existence, cat is of an unknown age and was adopted from a shelter. defamiliarization by describing as so austere and then revealing it at the end with picture
* the distinction between cognitohazards and regular ideas is political -- all ideas influence the recipient to some extent, and where exactly you say it's anomalous outside of bizarre effects is hard to define
* infectious cognitohazard that causes other people to perceive what they say totally differently. causes divergent, split society with different ideas and culture
* sleep (and the biologically mandatory aspect of it) are a containment procedure for humans. all humans who can live normally without sleep are to be contained even if they have no other anomalous properties. dreams and their subsequent anomalous properties are considered acceptable casualties, and normalized
* wikidot_token7
* Guy does ritual to become godlike, ends up waking irl
* "The Protagonist" - monitoring a reality bender who is clearly the main character of a show and everything essentially has to follow the story's narrative
* narrative bending: protagonist of poorly written story is forced into doing weird things/weird circumstances to cause a plot to unfold
* infohazardous anomaly which uses only conproc history to convey information about it. ends with a small (discovery?) addendum
* meta piece - represents a person's isolation and emotional state. Conprocs are their defensiveness and they deploy task force ("Need a Friend"). Differentiate from SCP-2442
* something about Mobile Task Force Beta-14 ("O5-7's Antique Roadshow Collectors") 
* scooby doo is normalcy propaganda. tale or other non-anomalous document describing how they use it to influence opinion
* anomaly which forces all those in its vicinity to act along the music. like king conga -- idea: they send in the SCP-3688-trained task force, MTF-Sigma-2 ("No Friends of Mine")
* area that exhibits hyperbolic curvature, so is extremely large despite a small radius. R^^2^^ x E. picture https://twitter.com/ratking6662/status/1312278267873783808
* intro or talk or guide or something on navigating noneuclidean space and conversationally explaining how hard it is to wrap your head around and the importance of using equipment (stuff like the navigation kit in standard agent field kit, includes two laser beams used to show behavior of "parallel" lines)
* tale about spouse with veil clearance cooperating with a goi. begins with "Most divorces don't end up before the Ethics Committee."
* foundation sends itself hints to the past. final one, o5-gated "move SCP-173 to Site-19"
* narrative pentagram/summoning - need to place a totem at the beginning of the story, in the middle, and at the end
* object that "freezes time" by speeding up brain performance 10000000x. d-class touches it for a split second then immediately lets go -- rest of the article is their trauma at living millennia stuck, immobile, trying to move away, plotting, thinking
* immortal sapient species. they have perfect youth/health, and regenerate injuries very quickly, making them extremely hard to kill. However they are part of an extremely brutal and coercive society which uses them for slave labor, with punishments near death (that they recover from) for infractions.
* "we know 055 isn't safe or euclid" -- what if it was thaumiel?
* skip about inceldom as a memetic infection (maybe fifthist?). reference green from 4838
* "The Stanford Prison Experiment" - shows how d-class are regular people treated as a disposable other
* society without crime enforced through a powerful global memetic geas. highlight aspects of crime that are favorable, such as social progress or resisting tyranny
* popular protests/riots, Foundation doesn't care or respond, then they get close to an anomaly contained there and they respond extremely violently to "maintain containment" but end up hurting the veil due to the disproportionate force
* corporate people who scavenge dead/dying (XK) universes for resources, especially exotic materials from the end of world scenario
* torture that's considered okay because they completely heal all the wounds/dismemberment after. hyperregenerative humans or something
* henry kissinger negotiated a deal with death where he got immortality in exchange for souls of american wars. however due to a clause in the contract it only actually lasts 100 years
* skip about the Sex Cycle
* Department of Tactical Theology Demonology Division either dealing with daemons or Maxwell's Demon
* (BYU-SA) Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life as the origin of mnestic drugs, specifically, the "delightsome" fruit of the tree. they set up their offices in the great and spacious building, and set up a laser array around the tree to prevent unauthorized consumption of fruit. the iron rod connects the opening to the tree, those who fall away find themselves either in the building or lost on other paths, which the foundation interprets as meaning only very loyal personnel are able to access the building. the building has no foundation, and so they install a reimannian (sp) spatial bridge.
* -J article about a thing that makes you better in interviews, lampshades the fact that "people who are victims of creepy shit are really good storytellers". "that interview is good enough to add to the scp file"
* dado home loan service yes where if no pay loan shark appear make u collect also underright service
* dado eat at home restaurant -- booming since COVID, you can eat out but at home. dado calls COVID the "beer virus"
* UIU presentation on how to identify Foundation agents in the field. Three categories: Open (e.g. 3ports), Veil (Spicy Crust Pizza), or Undercover (hard to detect, do not reveal you have identified them)
* "cryptographic biology" source: https://twitter.com/twowordhorror/status/1516144329080909829
* dado -- bank of pluto (from 4348)
* SPC about defeating loan sharks
* using time travel to move commodities around when they're more valuable (e.g. right now oil is worth nothing, move it back to the 70's oil crisis and make bank). talk about wasting supply for profit and price gouging
* time travel story involving one person and their various versions trying to coordinate, communicate, sabotage each other, in a very complicated, non-nice set of time loops
* anomalaundry skip, cross-link to 888-ex. basically dado tries to do anomalous laundry, it ends poorly
* anomaly that makes people panic over nothing, but the file is covering up the underlying issue. either that or a final collapsed image that's actually horrifying
* "breathtaking" - anomaly that takes your breath, you can't breathe
* end of the world, Foundation employee? someone keeps working on a project even though it can no longer affect the world because there's no people for it to serve; they are doing it for themselves, because they love the work and find it fulfilling
* KTE from GOC in falling-apart world, one of the few cells, liquidating "humanoid parathreats" who keep appearing. turns out it's SCP-2000. nascent foundation sends task forces over to find out why their humans kept disappearing
* SCP: "Instrumental", K-class scenario where all humans become omniscient (including knowing what all other humans know), and begin to lose a sense of self. Article is AIC-written, with a "please update TODO human" but hasn't been updated for a long time. Most human society, including the Foundation, cease to be
* multiversal Foundation gives up on a timeline, abandoning it. funding and connections disappear, Site-01 effectively goes offline. either made by a local researcher or an AIC
* hivemind entity, one "person" but shared mind and cloning ability, forms a sub-veil intelligence agency, SCPF can't really contain it so just kind of deal with it, occasionally buying intel or missions (smallfoundation, need to establish)
* smallfoundation ideass
 * directly mention the size of the Foundation in some way
 * directly mention the rarity of anomalies / anomalous groups
 * have a greater anomaly show up, but cut off from normal context
 * like, have a Church of the Broken God anomaly show up and the Foundation have no idea who they are
 * a recognizable character show up in a different context that makes it clear they're smaller in scale. Marshall, Carter and Darke show up but they're not an auction house, they're auctioneers. it's just the three of them without an extended company to back them
* god of war, contained by ensuring a certain amount of people suffer and die in war every year. foundation has plans to ensure a certain level of global strife. comment on military industrial complex. alternatively, foundation stopped needing to satisfy it because the US does more than enough already
* biblical angel: not some winged humanoid, but an incomprehensible being of pure directed force, weird eldritch stuff
* "Biblical Angle" a 2D shape which professes to be a deific figure from another reality. humor
* parallel universe where instead of a "foundation" there is a liberated or at least okay anomalous society which protects people and the anomalous
* international schisms where something is considered explained in europe but anomalous in the united states or vice eversa (SCP-X469)
* foundation makes a contract with lloyd's of london for insurance on containment of anomalies and sites. explained?
* skip that keeps setting off COMMAND.aic and automated security protocols. researchers can't tell if it's antimemetic or a strange anomalous bug in the detection system
* C programming, follow containment procedures exactly or you die
* metrocard that enables connection to the NY subway and the origin of MTF-Pi-1 "The One Complete Circle"
* "O5" card, which has a memetic component to allow full access. They're trying to block it and figure out who is making them
* disease caused by overuse of amnestics
* memetic disease with lots of contained humans. parallels to real-life cases of being institutionalized
* South Charlotte Prisons, foundation front company and article about the private prison industry, and the idea of using prisoners for profit rather than justice
* story about "D-class employee" recruitment in the "SCP Corporation" setting
* drapetomania ii (SCP-X851) a coghaz that makes d-class anti-authoritarian and resist poor treatment and coercion

* awcy artist dies creating fatal art, the scene is anomalous and describes their emotional and family situation
* tale about foundation photographers, and how they choose pictures for skips
* incident retroactively caused by the presence of Site-19
* concept skip about manual memory management
* euclid skip, PROPHECY.aic, Foundation project to predict the future. paratech that calculates based on tachyon field mapping, and then tries to understand what those mappings mean
* memetic contagion which is its own countermeme since it's absurd and needs build up for buy in
* Foundation Legal Department analyzing anomalous contracts
* contractual libertarian world/interactions
* linus torvalds yelling at Maxwellists submitting shitty patches. maybe he has a no-veil deal with the foundation regarding anomalous computing
* wizard sweatshop
* ranged weapon that fires all shots at once that you would've fired during that session (marked by holding it). time wackiness ensues
* anomaly which outputs everything submitted to bit buckets (e.g. {{/dev/null}}). used by the Foundation to spy on others. however they have to be careful any computers processing it don't write to null or it'll cause a feedback loop
* 3519 as a KTE from the perspective of the GOC
* alternate usa where libraries were not widespread historically and eventually eliminated due to the red scare
* tale about an ex-fifthist
* uses MTF-Omega-9 ("The Scrubs") to neutralize something
* GOC has the first move on a major anomaly, occupies a huge part of Manhattan under military rule. Foundation is kicked out, but has a couple undercover agents in the territory. what the anomaly actually is is unclear
* origin of amnestics. (3000 makes amnestics better, it itself is not how they work). forming the SCPF. how does amnestic therapy work?
