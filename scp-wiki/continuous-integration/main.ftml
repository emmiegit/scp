----

Intern Brian Davies threw up his hands.

"It's still failing? I reran it twice already."

While she wasn't his manager, Researcher Green had taken him under her wing. Seeing his frustration, she went over to take a look.

"What's wrong?"

He pointed.

"You can't just rerun it until it passes. This isn't a web server, this is core infrastructure that powers the life and livelihood of two billion humans."

"Okay. Yeah. But why is it failing? All my local instances run fine. It's just an upgrade to the neural connector library, I thought it'd be simple."

"Code is very complicated, so many interactions. Here," she sat down next to him, "imagine you're an engineer, designing a bike, right? You want to avoid moving parts because complicated interactions, wear and tear, and the rest. So the frame is sturdy, the handlebars can move but only on one axis, the wheels also turn in their own axis."

He nodded.

"Computers aren't like that. Every instruction can change the state. //All// of it is moving parts. That's why we have all our massive test infrastructure."

"I still don't get why this is happening to me though. I already ran it myself, did the normal tests, nothing is weird. But I run this big thing and it's complaining about caribou."

"That's probably a red herring. Look, this huge thing, it's a simulation inside our SIMULACRUM development cluster. It simulates a version of the real world, with all the server farms and everything, and then on those servers, it runs your SIMULACRUM instance. Which then runs each test scenario. Because that's what's happening in the real world, we want to be able to test for actual cross-network interactions. And then all the gazillions of simulated players and objects inside and their interactions. I've caught lots of bugs that never made it to hurt real people."

He didn't seem impressed.

She changed tracks. "Okay. When you run those tests, it is taking //real scenarios// done by //real people// in the //actual SIMULACRUM production cluster//, and replays them. Then it checks that they don't produce any errors or weird behavior. //Then// it simulates every manner of issue, network interruption, disk failure, memetic corruption, and ensures your changes can handle it. We are simulating a simulation of a //slice of reality// so you can feel confident that your new code is solid."

Davies paused. //That's// what all that log spam was about?

"So how do I fix my issue?"

"Well, have you looked at the logs?"

"Uh, no. How do I see it?"

"Here, look. You see this? If I had to guess you aren't checking the packet processor type. There's more than just the, uh, B3-neura one. Check the docs, I think it shouldn't be too bad." She pointed to a link on his terminal.

As she stirred her coffee, Davies opened the page and began looking through. She was right, he had skipped several kinds, anyone with those peripherals wouldn't have been able to create a stable connection, or, actually, any connection at all. Then because of that, the entity simulators were failing to load, and pools were...

"Fuck. I should've checked for this."

Researcher Green smiled. "Nah. Cheer up kid, that's what tests are for. You didn't do anything wrong, it's not like your change actually knocked out ten million people's spinal cords, it was just a simulation."

He wasn't sure how to feel about that.
